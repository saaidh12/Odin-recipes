    <h1><b>Confetti Rice</b></h1>

    <p> This Confetti Rice side dish has three different kinds of rice and some added goodies to make it colorful and delicious! I’ll just say this right up front. This recipe is kind of a commitment. You’ll dirty a few pans, but that all helps to result in the final, delicious rice dish. “Confetti” refers to the multitude of colors, textures and flavors in the dish. I don’t mind having a messy kitchen once in a while (since I enjoy cooking so much) if there is good food coming out in the end. Will you try it?</p>
