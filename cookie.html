    <h2><b>How to make Trippe chocolate chunk Cookie: </b></h2>
    <p>The complete, printable recipe is at the end of this post. Preheat oven to 350°F. Line baking sheets with parchment paper or silpat mats.

        Place the chocolate chips and butter in a large, heatproof (metal or pyrex) bowl set over a pan of simmering water. Stir until melted and smooth. If you happen to have a double boiler pan, you can use that instead.
         
        In another bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder and salt; set aside.
         
        In a large bowl, use an electric mixer to beat the eggs, brown sugar and vanilla on high speed until light and fluffy. Reduce the speed to low and beat in the melted chocolate mixture. Then mix in the dry ingredients and blend just until combined. Stir in the chocolate chunks, but leave out the optional, additional chunks.
         
        Drop heaping tablespoonfuls of the cookie dough onto the prepared baking sheets, keeping a round shape as much as possible; place 2 to 3 inches apart. If you’re using the extra chopped chocolate bar, place 2 to 3 chunks on top of each cookie.
